this project is created based on the instruction from http://www.studytrails.com/frameworks/spring/spring-hibernate-jpa.jsp
but changed to file DB and make table to be created automatically bu setting properties in persistence.xml

Also removed Initialization() from DBUtil.java

### *.DATA file not created 

when I first tried, there was no data file (*.data). Found the following text from the search


The script file contains the definition of tables and other database objects, plus the data for non-cached tables. The log file contains recent changes to the database. The data file contains the data for cached tables and the backup file is a zipped backup of the last known consistent state of the data file. All these files are essential and should never be deleted. If the database has no cached tables, the test.data and test.backup files will not be present. In addition to those files, HSQLDB database may link to any formatted text files, such as CSV lists, anywhere on the disk.
While the "test" database is operational, a test.log file is used to write the changes made to data. This file is removed at a normal SHUTDOWN. Otherwise (with abnormal shutdown) this file is used at the next startup to redo the changes. A test.lck file is also used to record the fact that the database is open. This is deleted at a normal SHUTDOWN. In some circumstances, a test.data.old is created and deleted afterwards.

therefore, should add  

hsqldb.default_table_type=cached;

to the URL

## *.LOG

Log files are getting deleted with Normal shutdown. So the process is killed, there will be no log file. 
Log file will be used if data file is corrupted or something. 

-- from the guide    
hile the "test" catalog is open, a test.log file is used to write the changes made to data. This file is removed at a normal SHUTDOWN. Otherwise (with abnormal shutdown) this file is used at the next startup to redo the changes. A test.lck file is also used to record the fact that the database is open. This is deleted at a normal SHUTDOWN.
